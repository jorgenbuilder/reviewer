//
// - highlight / description[]: parsed out of the proposer's markdown summary.
//   The NNS proposal `summary` field is free-form markdown. A parser should
//   pull the lead paragraph as `highlight` and split on `##`/`**Heading**`
//   boundaries to populate `description[]` (Features & Fixes, Rollout, etc.).
// - commits[].verified: each commit's reproducibility status. For modern
//   InstallCode proposals this is per-commit from the verifier; for legacy
//   embedded-WASM proposals there is no real commit, so derive a pseudo-hash
//   and set verified:false (see the "legacy" fixture).
// - verification: maps directly from the gh-verifier run conclusion
//   (success -> verified, failure -> failed, in_progress -> in_progress,
//   no run yet -> pending).
// - diff: from getProposalDiffStats; may be absent for legacy proposals.
// - argHash: null when the proposal carries no install arg (e.g. installs
//   with empty args, or legacy proposals).
